# SSL

## Installing

Devon provides a mechanism to automate `mkcert` and aid in distributing the trusted CA over Git for teams to use.

In order for Devon to use mkcert, you must install it. It's super easy to do and you can find the [instructions for your Operating System here](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation).

## Initializing a new CA

Currently the only way to initialize a new CA is [via the `devon init` command](/getting-started/). We will look at separating the process soon.

## Distributing

The CA keys and Certificates generated by Devon **should** be committed to your Git repository or other Version Control system. This makes it super easy to distribute a trusted CA for local development inside Teams.

Whenever a developer pulls down the repository for the first time, they **must** run `devon install`. This will, among other things, install the generated CA as trusted on their system.
