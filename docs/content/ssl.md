# SSL

## Installing

Devon provides a mechanism to automate `mkcert` and aid in distributing the trusted CA over Git for teams to use.

In order for Devon to use mkcert, you must install it. It's super easy to do and you can find the [instructions for your Operating System here](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation).

## Initializing a new CA

Currently the only way to initialize a new CA is [via the `devon init` command](/getting-started/). This will generate the `rootCA.pem` and `rootCA-key.pem` files for the Nginx proxy.

## Distributing

The CA keys and Certificates generated by Devon **should** be committed to your Git repository or other Version Control system. This makes it super easy to distribute a trusted CA for local development inside Teams.

Whenever a developer pulls down the repository for the first time, they **must** run `devon install`. This will, among other things, install the generated CA as trusted on their system.

## Adding new Domains

Your `.devon.ts` file will have a `domains` entry if you selected to generate certificates via `devon init`. This can be modified at any time, and should be followed by a `devon gen-certs` call to re-generate the certificates file to include the changes to `domains`.
